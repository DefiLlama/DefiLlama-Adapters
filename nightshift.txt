Hello Ser, I hope you are well rested and have woken to milk and honey!

GOOD NEWS!

It has been a long day BUT we have three funded markets running and the UI is updated! Neutron seem pretty happy so far. 

Duality IS LIVE!!

LESS GOOD NEWS!

We have two bugs

- The balance bug, I was going to attempt a fix by multiplying the amount by something like 0.95 as the discrepancy I saw was quite small but ran out of time. It is severe if we are not monitoring logs as it prevents new positions being made so the price gets stale. 
- A bug where the strategy buys its own liquidity. This is detailed in the TG channel. I began looking at this and potentially we are not cancelling orders that should be so it is buying itself.

Some things that came up today

- Neutron asked about withdrawing and how the float works, then suggested a queue.
- We need to think about rebalancing, either Av Stoik or widening the spread on one side if the amounts are imbalanced. 

I have sent a PR to DefiLlama with the NTRN/USDC strat. 

Thing I gracefully request from you

- Keep an eye on the markets and pricing, in the case that we see the balance bug the service needs to be restarted and it will rectify.
- If you have time please look at the balance bug
- If you have time please look at the buying own liquidity bug
- If you have time please check the signer balance. It was about 4.5 NTRN just now so should be fine. 

Thank you!
