##### Short Description (to be shown on DefiLlama):
Leofinance, the parent of Cubfinance, is an Established Project with a 2 Year Track Record of Building Blockchain-Based Applications. DeFi Yield Farming apps are a dime a dozen these days. Cub Finance is different because it is built as a branch of our LeoFi organization underneath the LeoFinance project.

The goal of Cub Finance is to adopt and build DeFi-based smart contracts for the entire LeoFinance project. Through BEP20 LEO (bLEO), CUB and the adoption of existing use cases in the space, we're using the basic starting point of the Cub Finance yield platform to build a new generation of DeFi apps to expand and service our community of thousands of MAUs.

LeoFinance started as a platform for crypto and finance content creators. Our flagship application - LeoFinance.io - connects the community on a web3 social media platform. Think of it as being similar to the popular Web2 blogging application "Medium" but on the blockchain.

##### forkedFrom (Does your project originate from another project):
Goose Finance and Autofarm

##### methodology (what is being counted as tvl, how is tvl being calculated):
Cub Finance has farms and what are call kingdoms on the platform (which are autocompounding farms of other platforms). 
All farms are included, except those that pool the CUB token. 
All kingdoms are included except one, which is the CUB token kingdom.

Where the farm is an LP token, that is decomposed into its underlyign assets, where it is a single asset farm, that asset is being used.
