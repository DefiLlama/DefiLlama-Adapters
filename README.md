## Work in progress

If you have any suggestions, want to contribute or want to chat, please join [our discord](https://discord.defillama.com/) and drop a message.

## Testing adapters
```
node test.js projects/pangolin/index.js
```

## Changing RPC providers
If you want to change RPC providers because you need archive node access or because the default ones don't work well enough you can do so by creating an `.env` file and filling it with the env variables to overwrite:
```
ETHEREUM_RPC="..."
BSC_RPC="..."
POLYGON_RPC="..."
FANTOM_RPC="..."
ARBITRUM_RPC="..."
OPTIMISM_RPC="..."
XDAI_RPC="..."
HARMONY_RPC="..."
```

The name of each rpc is `{CHAIN-NAME}_RPC`, and the name we use for each chain can be found [here](https://github.com/DefiLlama/defillama-sdk/blob/master/src/general.ts#L33)
