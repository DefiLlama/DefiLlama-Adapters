/**
 * LINE is a price-protected token.
 * It is issued by borrowing against locking a collateral.
 * If the token's price on DEXes grows after borrowing, the user will be able to sell it for profit.
 * If it falls, the user will be able to repay the loan and get their collateral back (less fees).
 * This is what ensures price protection.
 *
