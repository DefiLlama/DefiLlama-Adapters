    "sell tokens. A key feature is the dynamic pricing model for offers, where the amount of",
    "sell token required can change over the offer's duration based on predefined parameters.",
    "",
    "Core functionalities include:",
    "- Making offers with dynamic pricing (`make_offer`).",
    "- Taking offers with current market pricing (`take_offer`, `take_offer_permissionless`).",
    "- Managing offer vectors for price control (`add_offer_vector`, `delete_offer_vector`).",
    "- Closing offers (`close_offer`).",
    "- Program state initialization and management (`initialize`, `set_boss`, `add_admin`, `remove_admin`).",
    "- Vault operations for token deposits and withdrawals (`offer_vault_deposit`, `offer_vault_withdraw`).",

    "# Dynamic Pricing Model",

    "- `apr`: Annual percentage rate scaled by 1,000,000 (e.g., 1_000_000 = 1% APR).",
    "- `price_fix_duration`: Duration in seconds for each discrete pricing step.",

    "- Access controls are enforced, for example, ensuring only the `boss` can create offers or update critical state.",
    "- PDA (Program Derived Address) accounts are used for offer and token authorities, ensuring ownership.",
